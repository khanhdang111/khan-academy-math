Early Math is a beginning with simple math problems.

It starts with counting lessons 1 to 10 and 100 then 120. Learning to count helps us to know how to  count to the correct order of numbers.

Then I learned about addition and subtraction. It helps us learn to add and subtract well and will apply much in life.

The next is the geometry. It is a lesson helps us be familiar to the geometry including the pictures such as the square, rectangles(collectively referred to as quadrangles), the pentagon, hexagon, triangle,

circle, etc.
